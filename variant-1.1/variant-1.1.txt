Internet-Draft           EPP IDN Variant Mapping           December 2012


1.  Introduction

   Internationalized Domain Names have introduced the ability to specify
   domain names in scripts beyond basic latin, allowing many languages
   and scripts to be coded as domain names.  This however has led to
   forms of abuse, where malicious users exploit imperfections in the
   coding of languages in computers to register domain names with the
   intention of deceiving legitimate users.

   Registries, language experts and linguists have collaborated to
   define variant domain names as names that should be blocked from
   registration independent of the original name.  However, due to
   technological and contextual issues, some variant domain names should
   be activated and published in the DNS to provide satisfactory end
   user experience.  This document considers only activated variants;
   the listing of possible variants and blocked variants of a domain
   name is out of scope of this extension mapping.

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119 [RFC2119].

   "variant-1.1" is used as an abbreviation for
   "urn:ar:params:xml:ns:variant-1.1".  The XML namespace prefix
   "variant" is used, but implementations MUST NOT depend on it and
   instead employ a proper namespace-aware XML parser and serializer to
   interpret and output the XML documents.


2.  Object Attributes

   This extension adds additional elements to the EPP Domain Name
   Mapping [RFC5731].  Only those new elements are described here.

2.1.  Variant Domain Names

   The syntax for variant domain names MUST conform to the syntax for
   domain and host names described in the EPP Domain Name Mapping
   [RFC5731].  Servers MUST accept Internationalized Domain Names
   expressed as A-labels, and MAY accept variants expressed as U-labels.
   Servers MUST return A-labels in responses unless negotiated with the
   client using a mechanism outside this document.

   Servers SHOULD process query commands matching both the primary
   registered domain name and any activated variants, and MAY match
   withheld and blocked variants.  Servers SHOULD restrict the use of

   variants in transform commands, removing perception that variants may
   be treated as separate objects.

   Variants as simple attributes of domain names places some
   restrictions on servers, clients and end users.  In the absence of
   other extensions, it is not possible to associate a set of name
   servers to a variant independent of those name servers associated
   with the primary domain name.  Additionally, servers providing
   mechanisms for clients to have secure delegations will have to
   support the Key Data Interface of the EPP DNS Security Extensions
   Mapping [RFC5910] in the absense of other extensions that allow
   associating DS data with variant domain names.


3.  EPP Command Mapping

   A detailed description of the EPP syntax and semantics can be found
   in the EPP core protocol specification [RFC5730].  The command
   mappings described here are specifically for use in provisioning
   internationalized domain names.

3.1.  EPP Query Commands

   EPP provides three commands to retrieve object information: <check>
   to determine if an object is known to the server, <info> to retrieve
   detailed information associated with an object, and <transfer> to
   retrieve object transfer status information.

3.1.1.  EPP <check> Command

   This extension does not define any extension to the EPP <check>
   command or response described in the EPP Domain Name Mapping
   [RFC5731].

3.1.2.  EPP <info> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <info> command
   described in the EPP Domain Name Mapping [RFC5731].  However,
   additional elements are defined for the <info> response.

   To enable clients to determine the active variant domain names, the
   <domain:infData> response is extended with a <variant:infData>
   element that contains the following child elements:

   o  One or more <variant> elements containing the active variant
      domain names for this domain object.

       </trID>
     </response>
   </epp>

   To facilitate the transfer of domain names, the list of activated
   variants should be available to authorized clients prior to transfer.

Internet-Draft           EPP IDN Variant Mapping           December 2012


   Servers that require authorization information to begin the transfer
   process MAY restrict the list of activated variants to those commands
   where correct authorization information is provided.

3.1.3.  EPP <transfer> Command

   This extension does not define any extension to the EPP <transfer>
   command or response described in the EPP Domain Name Mapping
   [RFC5731].

3.2.  EPP Transform Commands

   EPP provides five commands to transform objects: <create> to create
   an instance of an object, <delete> to delete an instance of an
   object, <renew> to extend the validity period of an object,
   <transfer> to manage object sponsorship changes, and <update> to
   change information associated with an object.

3.2.1.  EPP <create> Command

   This extension does not add any elements to the EPP <create> command
   described in the EPP Domain Name Mapping [RFC5731].  However,
   additional elements are defined for the <create> response.

   Servers may automatically generate and activate variant domain names
   upon registration of specific domain names, based on rules determined
   by the server operator, and usually described in an IDN table.  In
   addition to the elements expressed in the <domain:creData>, the
   response is extended with a <variant:creData> element that contains
   the following child elements:

   o  One or more <variant:variant> elements containing the variant
      domain names automatically activated by the server.

       </trID>
     </response>
   </epp>

3.2.2.  EPP <delete> Command

   This extension does not define any extension to the EPP <delete>
   command or response described in the EPP Domain Name Mapping
   [RFC5731].

3.2.3.  EPP <renew> Command

   This extension does not define any extension to the EPP <renew>
   command or response described in the EPP Domain Name Mapping
   [RFC5731].

3.2.4.  EPP <transfer> Command

   This extension does not define any extension to the EPP <transfer>
   command or response described in the EPP Domain Name Mapping
   [RFC5731].

Internet-Draft           EPP IDN Variant Mapping           December 2012


3.2.5.  EPP <update> Command

   This extension defines additional elements for the EPP <update>
   command described in the EPP Domain Name Mapping [RFC5731].  No
   additional elements are defined for the EPP <update> response.

   The EPP <update> command provides a transform operation that allows a
   client to modify the attributes of a domain object.  Servers may,
   subject to local policy, allow the modification of the list of
   activated variants for a domain name.  In addition to the elements
   expressed in the <domain:update>, the command is extended with a
   <variant:update> element that contains the following child elements:

   o  An optional <variant:rem> element containing child <variant:
      variant> elements describing the variant domain names that should
      be withheld from delegation in the DNS.

   o  An optional <variant:add> element containing child <variant:
      variant> elements describing the variant domain names that should
      be activated and delegated in the DNS.

   Example <update> command to activate a variant domain name

   <?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
   <epp xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:epp-1.0">
     <command>
       <update>
         <update xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:domain-1.0">
           <name>xn--eqrt2g948bija.example</name>
         </update>
       </update>
       <extension>
         <update xmlns="urn:ar:params:xml:ns:variant-1.1">
           <add>
             <variant>xn--eqrt2g7t9bc8a.example</variant>
           </add>
         </update>
       </extension>
       <clTRID>ABC-12345</clTRID>
     </command>
   </epp>

   In order to support local business rules, servers MAY reject commands
   that to update both the list of active variants and modify other
   domain attributes.

   An EPP object mapping is specified in XML Schema notation.  The
   formal syntax presented here is a complete schema representation of
   the object mapping, suitable for automated validation of EPP XML
   instances.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This memo includes no request to IANA.


6.  Security Considerations

   The mapping extensions described in this document do not provide any
   security services beyond those described by EPP [RFC5730], the EPP
   Domain Name Mapping [RFC5731], and protocol layers used by EPP.  The
   security considerations described in these other specifications apply
   to this specification as well.
